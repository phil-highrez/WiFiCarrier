# WiFiCarrier
Tweak to display the WiFi SSID as Carrier. 

This is updated to work on IOS 13 as the orriginal did not. It may still work on older IOS versions but is currently untested.
It also allows you to customize the carrier (network operator) text in the IOS status bar and to detect when WiFi Calling is enabled allowing you append custom text to the SSID / Custom Carrier

Based on NoisyFlake's orriginal version with some new settings.
